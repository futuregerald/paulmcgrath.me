I'm a software developer, design enthusiast, and amateur photographer from Cork, Ireland.

I'm passionate about solving **user-oriented problems**. Whether UI or API, the user is my highest priority.

I keep busy by contributing to open-source projects; developing and designing for cloud, web, and mobile; and participating in makerspace communities.

If you'd like to know more, my resume is on [linkedIn][linkedin]. I also [code][github], [tweet][twitter], [instagram][insta], and can always be contacted [here][contact].
