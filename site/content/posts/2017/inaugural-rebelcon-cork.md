I recently attended [Rebel Con][rebelcon], Cork's first-of-its-kind conference about current technologies, 
culture, and development best practices.

## Should I go?

**Yes!** Especially if you're living or working in Cork.

It would be a shame to miss out on what will surely become an annual event for Cork's development and 
engineering cultural circles.

Hosting the event at the modern Republic of Work co-working space really set the stage for the excellent 
trend-oriented talks presented by developers from local companies. It was really wonderful to see 
such enthusiasm and skill on show, especially in the small city that I call home.
 
Here's to an even better RebelCon in 2018!

 
## Speaker Videos

All of the conference talks can be found [here][rebelVideos], but the following are particularly worth watching:

* [Solving Javascript Gripes with Elm][elm]

* [Building a Platform that Handles as Many Requests as Amazon.com][requests]

* [Introduction to event sourcing and CQRS][duncan]

* [How to increase visibility of distributed systems in production][monitoring]
