I recently attended [Craft][craft] in Budapest, which is an incredible conference about Software Craftsmanship.

## Should I go?

**Yes!** Don't even think twice.

The speakers were excellent, the venue was impressive, and the events themselves well-organised. 
If I could go back to any conference next year, it'd be this one.

For a really nice intro and summary video, [check this out][summaryCraft].
 
## Speaker Videos

Almost all of the conference talks can be found [here][craftVideos].  
(Click "Other Channels" at the bottom to see talks from the other stages.)
